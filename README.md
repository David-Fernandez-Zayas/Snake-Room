## Introduction

**Snake Room** is a game built for the CS50x Scratch assignment. The goal is to create a fun and functional game while fulfilling all required Scratch programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and custom blocks.

## Features

- **Simple Mechanics:** Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Clear Objective:** Eat all the mice without touching any bombs.
- **Immediate Feedback:** The game ends immediately upon winning or losing.
- **Lightweight and Engaging:** Quick to play and easy to understand.

## Technical Requirements

This project meets the CS50x "Starting from Scratch" assignment requirements:

- ‚úÖ At least **two sprites** (snake, mouse, and bomb).
- ‚úÖ At least **three scripts** total.
- ‚úÖ Use of at least one **conditional**, one **loop**, and one **variable**.
- ‚úÖ A **custom block** with at least one input (e.g., for movement or interactions).
- ‚úÖ Simpler than advanced projects like *Oscartime* but more complete than lecture demos.

## Project Structure

- `snake-room.sb3`: The Scratch project file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Play

1. **Open the project** in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) or download the `.sb3` file and open it in the Scratch offline editor.
2. **Use the arrow keys** to move the snake around the screen.
3. **Eat all the mice** by touching them.
4. **Avoid the bombs!** Touching a bomb ends the game.
5. **You win** by eating all the mice without hitting any bombs.

## Graphic Assets

The project uses simple, Scratch-style sprites:
- üêç **Snake** (player-controlled)
- üê≠ **Mice** (targets to collect)
- üí£ **Bombs** (obstacles to avoid)

All assets were created or adapted specifically for this game.
